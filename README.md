# ATM22 Library
Arduino and STM32 libraries for absolute encoder of the ATM22 series (12 bit or 14 bit version) by CUI Devices.

## Device
CUI Devices AMT22 series is a rugged, high accuracy absolute encoder outputting 12 bits or 14 bits of absolute position information with Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication. Combined with an operating temperature range of -40째C to +125째C, high accuracy, a compact package, and low current draw, the AMT22 provides a compelling solution for a range of industrial, automation, robotics, and renewable energy applications.
